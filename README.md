# Workshop2
I made a function called BlueCircle100 that takes a center point and returns a blue circle with radius 100. I then made a function called ColoredCircle100 that takes in two inputs, a center point and a color. It then makes a circle with radius 100 with that center point and color. I then made a function called ClickCircle100 that takes in as input a color, then waits for the user to click and makes a circle of that color and radius 100 around where the user clicked. I made a function called Square that takes in as input a side length and a point which becomes the upper left corner of the square, and then creates a square of that side length and corner. I then made a function called House which takes in a point and creates a house shape around that point.
